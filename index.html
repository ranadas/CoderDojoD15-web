                                computer programming in a fun and relaxed way. Everybody is welcome to come and learn to write <br>
                                website, create apps, make games and enjoy themselves. All you need is a laptop.</p><br>

                                Here at CoderDojo we can never have enough mentors to help out. Anyone can be come a mentor but remember this is purely <br>
                                voluntary. So if you are willing to give up your Saturday morning we will be more than happy. Knowledge of a programming <br>
                                language is recommended but is not 100% necessary. Check out the enquiry form to the right.</p><br>

                        <p align="left"> Scratch is a multimedia authoring tool that can
                            be used by students,teachers and parents for a range of educational
                            and entertainment constructivist purposes from math and science projects
                            , including simulations and visualizations ofexperiments, recording lectures
                            with animated presentations, to social sciences animated stories, and interactive
                            art and music.Simple games may be made with it, as well.</p>

                        <p align="left"  style="font-family:arial;color:white;font-size:30px">HTML</p><br>
                        <p align="left"> HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages.HTML is written in the form of HTML elements
                            consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like html). HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like h1 and /h1., although some tags represent empty
                            elements and so are unpaired, for example img. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening
                            tags and closing tags). Though not always necessary, it is best practice to append a slash to tags which are not paired with a closing tag.</p>

                        <p align="left">It allows newcomers to computer programming to create software applications for the Android operating system (OS). It uses a graphical
                            interface, very similar to Scratch and the StarLogo TNG user interface, which allows users to drag-and-drop visual objects to create an application
                            that can run on Android devices. In creating App Inventor, Google drew upon significant prior research in educational computing, as well as work done
                            within Google on online development environments.</p>

                            The belt and badge system is a new system that is being introduced <br>
                            to CoderDojo D15. It includes giving children belts and badges as they<br>
                            pass certain goals, hit set milestones or write a piece of code that stands above the rest. When you finish a class in CoderDojo D15 you will recieve a
                            badge next to your name on your profile on the CoderDojo D15 official website. This will notify your peers of what you have done in
                            each class and to what extent do you know your code. The belt system is a more prestigious system.
                            In which we award children yellow, red, blue and possibly even black belts. The yellow belts will be awarded for a significant achievement in introduction
                            classes. The red belts will be given for children who have passed above their peers in the more advanced classes. The blue belts will be given
                            when a child has done an incredible achievement in the more advanced classes that shocked mentors. The black belts will only be awarded on very
                            unique occasions. You have passed above the knowledge of your mentor and done something that stands out in the whole of CoderDojo D15. You might then be allowed
                            to become a mentor! Inside these belts there will be a USB storage stick. The storage capacity will range from 2GB in the lower belts To 8GB in the black.
                            These belts will notify your peers of your outstanding achievements in CoderDojo D15.
                            <br><br>

                            DISCLAIMER:<br>
                            This belt and badge system is unique to CoderDojo D15 and will not be recognised in other dojos. (except maybe in the cases of the Black belt)

                    <p>This is CoderDojo D15 and we would like to welcome anyone who wants to participate and/or donate
                        to us.</p>
                    Donating will go towards buying things to enhance the kids experiences and immerse them deeper into the
                    world of technology. We would let them have at things like Arduino or Lego MindStorm. These are sets that
                    let children and adults alike delve into circuit building and programming. Creating their own circuits
                    from their own ideas or simply building a standard circuit to learn. We would like to encourage companies
                    to take part in donating as it is towards a great cause. The future IT in Ireland. This will give the children
                    an early start and so they will be more knowledgeable in the subjects of software developing and circuitry when
                    they leave school or maybe even take up a role in your company! Donation money will also go towards CoderDojo
                    D15's "Belt" project, in which we give belts of different colour to kids that they can wear around their wrist.
                    These will go up in traditional martial art fashion further enhancing the Dojo experience. But there is one more thing.
                    The belts have a USB drive inserted into them with bigger storage space as the child develops more skills and reaches certain goals.
                    We would like to thank ITB for funding our first set of belts which were the beginning of something truly special. These were our white belts,
                    the starting grade in martial arts. We would also like to thank ITB again for letting us use their facilities to base coderdojo.
                    It is a brilliant setting for the kids as this is where they might even go in the future or further education.
                    All donations first go to the Hello World Foundation which is the fully registered charity that helped fund CoderDojo initially.
                    This donation will then be sent on to the dojo of your choice. Thank you. We look forward to seeing
                    the children digging in to the Arduinos, Lego MindStorms and Belts that you have kindly funded!
                    <br><br>
